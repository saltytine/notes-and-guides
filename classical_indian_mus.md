## shruti

in western music, you have 12 equally spaced semitones per octave (12-tet).
in indian music, instead of rigidly spaced semitones, you have shruti, which are microtonal pitch steps. classical theory says there are 22 shrutis in an octave. but you can have more or less.

these 22 shrutis are not evenly spaced. some intervals are tighter, some wider, based on how the ear perceives consonance. so it isn’t equal temperament, it's more natural, more based on harmonic ratios (like 3/2 for a perfect fifth, 5/4 for a major third, etc).

each raga uses a subset of those shrutis, emphasizing certain microtonal pitches and ignoring others. the "same note" across ragas can be pitched slightly differently.

## raga

a raga is not a scale, its more undefined.

every raga defines:

* arohana (ascending pattern) and avarohana (descending pattern)
  these aren't always the same, some ragas skip notes going up, but not down.

* vadi (most important note)

* samvadi (second-most important note, often a fourth or fifth from the vadi)

* pakad – characteristic phrase, what we would call a motif

### example: raga yaman

* arohana: n3 r2 g3 m# p d2 n3 s
* avarohana: s n3 d2 p m# g3 r2 s
* vadi: ga (g3)
* samvadi: ni (n3)
* key note: tivra ma (m#) – a sharpened 4th, but not 12-tet sharp. it's tuned around 11/8 or 45/32 (approx).

## swaras, for the previous example

indian music uses seven basic notes (called saptak):

* s – shadja (root, tonic)
* r – rishabh (2nd)
* g – gandhar (3rd)
* m – madhyam (4th)
* p – pancham (5th)
* d – dhaivat (6th)
* n – nishad (7th)

s and p are fixed and don't change.
the others have variants (flat or sharp).

### swara variants

the numbers next to r, g, d, n (and sometimes m) refer to which variant is being used:

* r (rishabh):

  * r1 – komal rishabh (flat 2nd)
  * r2 – shuddha rishabh (natural 2nd)

* g (gandhar):

  * g2 – komal gandhar (flat 3rd)
  * g3 – shuddha gandhar (natural 3rd)

in most systems, r1 + g2 and r2 + g3 can overlap a bit, so sometimes people simplify and just say g3 = major 3rd, g2 = minor 3rd, etc.

* m (madhyam):

  * m1 – shuddha madhyam (natural 4th)
  * m2 – tivra madhyam (sharp 4th)
  * or shorthand: m / m# (like i did above)

* d (dhaivat):

  * d1 – komal dhaivat (flat 6th)
  * d2 – shuddha dhaivat (natural 6th)

* n (nishad):

  * n2 – komal nishad (flat 7th)
  * n3 – shuddha nishad (natural 7th)

so when you see:

arohana: n3 r2 g3 m# p d2 n3 s

it means:

* n3 → shuddha nishad (natural 7th)
* r2 → shuddha rishabh (natural 2nd)
* g3 → shuddha gandhar (natural 3rd)
* m# → tivra madhyam (sharp 4th)
* p → pancham (perfect 5th)
* d2 → shuddha dhaivat (natural 6th)
* s → shadja (tonic)

this is the ascending scale of raga yaman.
the descending (avarohana) is usually the same or different depending on the raga. in this case:
avarohana: s n3 d2 p m# g3 r2 s
means you return down in the same pattern, keeping the same notes.

## gamakas

gamakas are microtonal "gestures".

different ragas use different gamakas for the same notes.

types of gamakas:

* meend – a glide or portamento between two notes (like a slide on a fretless instrument, perhaps my fretless bass, not a flex btw)
* andolan – slow oscillation around a pitch
* kampitam – rapid vibrato-like movement
* jaru – a kind of soft slide that doesn't hit the target note sharply
* spuritam – quick jump back and forth between two notes
* khatka/murki – grace note clusters or rapid flicks

### example:

in raga todi, you can’t just *play* ga flat. it’s like saying "gaaaaa" with a swoop. if you just play a plain note, it kinda ruins the fun.

the effect this kind of thing has is that notation becomes very difficult. you need to learn ragas by listening, singing, and imitating, not by reading sheet music.

## just intonation

indian music traditionally uses just intonation, where notes are based on small whole number ratios of frequencies (like 3/2, 5/4, 9/8, etc). this gives a consonance and clarity you don’t get in 12-tet.

example comparison:

* a perfect fifth (p5) in 12-tet = 700 cents
* in just intonation = 702 cents (3/2)
* a major third (m3) in 12-tet = 400 cents
* in just intonation = 386 cents (5/4)

it doesn't seem like it makes a huge difference, but the just intoned stuff feels much better to the ear.

each raga can also tweak pitches slightly. that’s why two ragas with "same" scales can sound completely different.

## tala

tala is the rhythmic cycle system. it can be:

* simple (like adi tala = 8 beats)
* or crazy complex (like jhampa tala = 10 beats in a 5+2+3 structure)

tala is cyclical. it’s more of a loop than something measure by measure, and a lot of tension/release is built into the cycle.

a lot of times musicians will have gestures for counting beats, like:

* claps (ta)
* waves (no sound, but gesture matters)
* finger counts

## improvisation

indian classical is very improvisational, but not freeform. you improvise within the grammar of the raga and tala.

for example, a performance might have:

* alaap – slow, unmetered exploration of the raga
* jor/jhala – rhythmic exploration
* bandish (hindustani) or kriti (carnatic) – fixed composition
* then improv on that composition, varying rhythm, phrasing, and gamakas
